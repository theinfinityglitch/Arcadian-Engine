# About

This engine is being developed with the game [Orbit Rush by NebulaNest Studios](https://nebulaneststudios.itch.io/orbitrush) as a replacement for the old Godot 4 codebase. There's no main reason to this engine exist, but it's mostly for the fun of doing things from scratch and for learning purposes. This engine may be called Arcadian Engine C# on a near future, as I'm (Alan - The Infinity Glitch, the developer) planning to remake it in a AOT compiled language and with a custom backend to support more complex and perfomance intesive projects that we're planning.
